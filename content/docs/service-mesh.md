## Service Mesh

### Staging Versions

Service mesh will route traffic to given services.  Services can have multiple versions of
the service deployed at once and then the you can control how much traffic, or which traffic
is routed to each version.

### rio stage [OPTIONS] SERVICE_ID_NAME

The `rio stage` command takes all the same options as `rio create` but instead of updating
the existing service, it will stage a new version of the service.  For example, below is
scenario to do a canary deployment.

```bash

# Create a new service
$ rio run -p 80/http --name test/svc --scale=3 ibuildthecloud/demo:v1

# Ensure service is running and determine public URL
$ rio ps
NAME       IMAGE                    CREATED          SCALE     STATE     ENDPOINT                                  DETAIL
test/svc   ibuildthecloud/demo:v1   17 seconds ago   3         active    http://svc.test.8gr18g.lb.rancher.cloud   

# Stage new version, updating just the docker image and assigning it to "v2" version.
$ rio stage --image=ibuildthecloud/demo:v3 test/svc:v3

# Notice a new URL was created for your staged service
$ rio ps
NAME          IMAGE                    CREATED        SCALE     STATE     ENDPOINT                                     DETAIL
